It's all started with a question \"How many times do you need to fold a 1mm thick piece of paper to reach the Moon?\". Knowing that a distance to the Moon is about 394 600 km, we can easily find an answer:<span class=\"note\"><span class=\"math\">log_2 (3.946*10^{11}) \\approx 39</span></span></p><br /><p>After that we talked about the A series paper size. I mentioned that A0 has an area of <span class=\"math\">1m^2</span> and every An has a ratio of sides (longest to shortest) equal to <span class=\"math\">\\sqrt{2}</span>. This ratio is used because it is preserved after folding the longest side in half. One guy asked me if it is possible to proof that this is the only ratio with that property. I've managed to proof it with simple algebraic transformations.</p><br /><p>Let's assume we have a sheet of paper with sides a and b, a < b < 2a. The ratio is <span class=\"math\">\\frac{b}{a}</span>. After we fold it, we got a new short side <span class=\"math\">\\frac{b}{2}</span>, and long side a. The new ratio <span class=\"math\">\\frac{a}{b/2}</span> should be equal to old ratio:<span class=\"note\"><span class=\"math\">\\begin{eqnarray}\\frac{b}{a} &=& x \\\\ a\\cdot\\frac{2}{b} &=& x\\end{eqnarray}</span></span></p><p>Let's find the x:</p><span class=\"note\"><span class=\"math\">\\begin{eqnarray}\\frac{b}{a} &=& x, \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{1}{x} \\\\ \\frac{2a}{b} &=& x, \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{x}{2} \\\\ \\frac{x}{2} &=& \\frac{1}{x} \\\\ \\frac{x^2}{2} &=& 1 \\\\ x^2 &=& 2 \\\\ x &=& \\sqrt{2}\\end{eqnarray}</span></span><br /><br />",
