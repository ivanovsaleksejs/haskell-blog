    "content":"<p>I was thinking about Goldbach conjecture recently, and I came up with slightly different, but related question.</p><br /><p>For those who are not familiar with Goldbach conjecture - it states that</p><span class=\"note\">Every even integer above 2 can be expressed as sum of 2 primes.</span><br /><p>By far, it's neither proved nor disproved. You can apply this conjecture on any positive number above 1 if you express even number as some number times 2:</p><span class=\"note math\">2n = p + q</span><br /><p>By doing some simple transformations, we can get this:</p><span class=\"note math\">n + n = p + q<br />(n -k) + (n + k) = p + q<br />pq = (n - k)(n + k) = n<sup>2</sup> - k<sup>2</sup><br />n<sup>2</sup> = k<sup>2</sup> + pq</span><br /><p>Product of two (not necessarily distinct) primes is called semiprime. So, we can rephrase conjecture as</p><span class=\"note\">For every integer n above 1 there is at least one integer k less than n where difference of squares of these two numbers is odd semiprime.</span><br /><p>This is quite natural conclusion when you think about Goldbach conjecture for 5 minutes. However, I came up with different kind of statement:</p><span class=\"note\">Every odd semiprime can be expressed as the difference of two perfect squares.</span><br /><p>You can clearly see that this statement is not really equal to Goldbach conjecture (at least I could not prove it). By equal I mean that proving one, the other will follow naturally.</p><p>And actually, this statement can be proved easily. In fact, every odd number is the difference of two squares:</p><span class=\"note math\">(n + 1)<sup>2</sup> - n<sup>2</sup> =<br />(n + 1 - n)(n + 1 + n) =<br />2n + 1</span><p>which is a very definition of odd numbers. So, if it's possible to prove that Goldbach conjecture is equal to the statement that all semiprimes are difference of two perfect squares, then it will automatically prove Goldbach conjecture.</p><br /><br />",
